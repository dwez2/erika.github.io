	<h2>Powering Success Through Collaboration: Leading with Purpose, Serving with Impact</h2>
	<br></br>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/motherboard.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
	As an IT professional and people-first leader, I believe success is built through trust, teamwork, and clear communication. Whether leading service desk operations, managing cross-functional projects, or supporting technical staff, I’m committed to building environments where everyone feels empowered to contribute and grow.
	<br><br>
	I bring a balance of technical skill and emotional intelligence to every role—whether solving infrastructure issues, mentoring junior team members, or aligning IT goals with business priorities. I’m known for stepping in when needed, removing roadblocks, and creating a culture where collaboration isn’t just encouraged—it’s expected.
	<br><br>
	As John C. Maxwell wrote in <em>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em>: <strong>“The true measure of leadership is influence—nothing more, nothing less.”</strong> My goal is to lead with influence, not authority, and to elevate both systems and people with every project I’m part of.
	<br><br>
	Let’s build the kind of IT team that gets noticed—not just for what we fix, but for how we lead.

<h3>Cost Optimization in Action: Reducing Waste, Increasing Value</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/savingmoney.jpg" alt="" /></span>
In my last three roles, I’ve proactively identified and eliminated cost inefficiencies across cloud infrastructure, licensing, and vendor services. One notable example included shutting down unused AWS instances, saving the company $5K–$8K per month. But my focus on cost optimization didn’t stop there—I extended the same discipline to software audits, ISP consolidations, and unnecessary licensing renewals, saving companies tens of thousands annually.
<br><br>
As an IT leader, I’ve never seen cost control as “just a finance issue.” I believe every dollar should support operations, improve efficiency, or create long-term value. As John C. Maxwell states in <em>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em>: <strong>"The Law of Addition: Leaders add value by serving others."</strong> My approach is rooted in adding value through strategic IT management—finding savings, maximizing resources, and aligning technology with business goals.
</p>
<br></br>

<h3>Enterprise System Cleanup & Software Integration</h3>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/cameras2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
Across multiple roles, I’ve led enterprise-wide efforts to clean up legacy systems and ensure secure, efficient IT environments. This includes restructuring Active Directory, fixing broken SharePoint permissions, and leading post-acquisition software integrations across newly merged companies.
<br><br>
These projects required detailed planning, cross-department collaboration, and change management to minimize disruption while improving system performance and compliance. The result? Streamlined workflows, tighter security, and systems that actually support the people using them.
</p>
<br></br>

<h3>Building from the Ground Up: Infrastructure That Supports Scale and Safety</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/relocate.jpg" alt="" /></span>
In every company I’ve worked at, I’ve either built IT infrastructure from the ground up or had to overhaul neglected spaces. From brand-new clinic setups to fixing networking issues in outdated or makeshift offices, I’ve ensured that IT areas are safe, organized, and built for long-term reliability.
<br><br>
A clean and structured environment isn't just about appearance—it's about reducing downtime, improving troubleshooting, and avoiding safety hazards. I’ve worked with vendors to reroute cabling, mounted access points in secure areas, and restructured network closets to meet professional standards and support scalability.
