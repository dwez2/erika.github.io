									<h3>Bridging the Gap: From Classroom Concepts to Real-World CIS Controls Implementation <br />
									</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/CIS ControlsImg.png" alt="" /></span>As I traverse the path from academia to the professional realm, the significance of CIS controls has only grown more pronounced. The concepts and knowledge imparted during my bachelor's and graduate studies have taken on tangible form in my current job, where we diligently adhere to 53 IT controls annually. CIS controls have become the bedrock of our organization's cybersecurity and risk management strategy. From configuring secure systems to implementing robust access controls, I am continuously applying the principles I studied in school to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Embracing the rigor of IT audit controls, I find myself drawing upon the very foundations laid during my educational journey. As I navigate this dynamic landscape, I am driven by the vision of fostering a secure and resilient digital environment for our company, where the bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation stands strong.

								<h2> Fortifying Cybersecurity: Unraveling the Impact of Essential CIS Controls </h2>
								<p> For my class report, I chose to focus on a few essential CIS controls that have become a vital framework adopted by businesses worldwide. These controls play a crucial role in fortifying business operations and ensuring strong cybersecurity measures. As I presented my findings in class, I couldn't help but realize the profound impact of comprehending and implementing these controls. They not only shape my current career but also pave the way for a seamless transition into managing IT audit controls, ultimately safeguarding critical assets for the long haul. The insights gained from exploring these CIS controls have reaffirmed their significance in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity and risk management.  </p>

								<h2> Mastering Vulnerability Assessment: A Journey with Nessus on Kali Linux</h2>
								<p> In this assignment, I embarked on an insightful journey to learn the art of performing vulnerability scans using Nessus on my Kali Linux virtual machine. Equipped with a Kali Linux VM and various target machines, including Windows XP, Windows 2K8 server, and Metasploitable Linux 2, I meticulously followed the steps outlined in the Weidman textbook. Downloading and installing Nessus, configuring the scanner, and generating scan reports for each VM provided invaluable hands-on experience. As I delved deeper into the assignment, I encountered a few hurdles, but with determination and troubleshooting skills, I successfully overcame them. The insights gained from researching the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database enriched my understanding of specific vulnerabilities identified in the scan reports. This assignment has been a pivotal moment in my cybersecurity journey, and I'm thrilled to showcase the scan results, along with the CVE information, on my website. The knowledge gained through this exercise has equipped me with a potent toolset for ensuring robust security measures and driving meaningful impact in the realm of cybersecurity. </p>

								<h3>Cyber security competition 2021</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/club.jpg" alt="" /></span>Having been appointed Cyber Security President. One of our club activities consisted of participating in a competition. We had to protect our infrastructure to make sure that we don't get attacked. Learning our vulnerabilities, patching and blocking from attack as a team. Game day we didn't have any information about what we were going to protect. We had to make sure that all of the bases were covered when they opened up. We had about five servers and different desktops computers that we had to work as a team and protect. This was so much fun and a great learning experience. </p>
